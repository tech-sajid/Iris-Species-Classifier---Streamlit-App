# Iris-Species-Classifier-Streamlit-App
This app is a web-based classifier for the Iris dataset built using Streamlit and RandomForestClassifier from sklearn. It predicts the species of an iris flower based on user-selected feature values: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Key Features
Interactive UI: Users can adjust sliders for each feature of the iris flower.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier to predict the species based on user input.
Real-Time Prediction: Instantly predicts and displays the species as users adjust the input features.
